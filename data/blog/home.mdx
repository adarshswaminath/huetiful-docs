![Huetiful](./content/images/huetiful-logo.png)

JavaScript library for simple color manipulations based on the [Culori](https://culorijs.org) API.

### What you can do with this package

- Filter arrays of color according to different properties i.e hue,saturation etc
- Sort arrays of colors according to their properties like luminance and hue.
- Create colors from template values like pastels, hueshifted color scales, paired schemes etc!
- Reference to all colors in the default TailwindCSS palette with every shade as a function!
- Categorize colors using their properties such as temperature and achromatic/chromatic .
- Get values of statistical significance (such as min and max hue values) from arrays of colors.

Sort of like a lodash for color...

> #### Nice to know
>
> All the functions come with TypeScript IntelliSense autocomplete for built-in parameters and are documented using TSDoc for code description during development. No need to cram the docs!
